Kaggle Online Ad Classification with Machine Learning

This project was created by myself, Emily Sharata and Yelizavita Godovanyuk for a Machine Learning Course at University of Geneva. 

How to go about the project:

1. Read through the project report to understand the goals and objectives of the classification task. 
2. Understand the data through exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. 
3. We have applied the following algorithms on data:
 - Logistic Regression
 - KNN
 - SVM
 - Random Forest
 - Boosted Trees
 - Neural Networks

The report concludes that using a ensemble of XG Boosting, random forest and Neural networks helped us achieved the rank of 3/21 in the overall class performance. 


We hope you learn how to apply various classification models on binary response variables!
